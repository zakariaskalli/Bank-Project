# 🏦 Bank Management System – Console App (C++ | Functional Programming)

## 🔹 Description

This project is a **Bank Management System** developed as a **Console Application in C++** using a **Functional Programming** approach. It provides a simple, menu-driven interface to manage clients, users, and transactions without using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The project focuses on practicing file-based data storage and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with dedicated functions handling each feature. It is the foundational version before transitioning to a more

## 🔹 Key Features

- **Client Management:**
  - Show all clients with details.
  - Add new clients with unique account numbers.
  - Delete clients.
  - Update client information.
  - Find clients by account number or other details.

- **Transactions Module:**
  - Deposit funds.
  - Withdraw funds.
  - Transfer funds between clients.
  - Show transaction history (if implemented).

- **User Management:**
  - Add, update, delete, and find users.
  - Simple role management (if implemented).

- **File-Based Data Persistence:**
  - All client, user, and transaction data is saved to and read from text files.
  - Ensures data remains after the program closes.

- **Console Interface:**
  - Simple, numeric menu driven UI.
  - Easy to navigate for users.

## 🔹 Why This Project Matters

This project was a great exercise to build a functional banking system prototype using only core C++ and functional programming concepts. It helped in:

- Learning how to manipulate files for persistent data storage.
- Implementing real-world banking operations without databases.
- Understanding modular design and function decomposition.
- Preparing the ground for a more advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) version.
